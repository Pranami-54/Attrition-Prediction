# Employee Attrition Prediction Using Random Forest

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition using a Random Forest classifier. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a web application for making predictions based on user input.

## Files Included
- **Attrition Prediction web page.py**: Python script for the web application that allows users to input employee data and receive attrition predictions.
- **Attrition_data.csv**: Dataset containing employee data used for training and testing the model.
- **Employee_Attrition.twbx**: Tableau workbook for visualizing the employee attrition data.
- **Employee_Attrition.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation using Random Forest.
- **Predictive_system.py**: Python script containing functions to preprocess input data and predict the outcome using the trained Random Forest model.
- **cleaned_data.csv**: CSV file containing the preprocessed data ready for model training.
- **label_encoders.pkl**: Pickle file containing label encoders used for categorical data.
- **trained_model.sav**: Serialized Random Forest model trained on the attrition dataset.

## Installation and Usage
